DIRECTORY EXPLAINATION:

Two runs were performed for the samples to increase DNA retrieval.
This directory only focuses on the merged raw files from those two runs.
The runs are HN00147677/ and HN00147680/
located at: st1/hdd/pg/human_data_processing/platforms/novaseq_macrogen/snlab/



DIRECTORY SUMMARY:

1) processRaw
Novaseq samples were processed with seqPro
Includes: trimming, alignment, duplicate removal.

2) mergePlatform
Novaseq samples were merge with miseq samples
Includes: indel realignment, mapping quality filtering, read length filtering, softclipping.

3) READ
Genetic relatedness was estimated for samples.

4) READ2
Genetic relatedness was estimated for individuals.

5) sexing
Determine molecular sex of individuals.

6) hapMt
Determine mitochondrial haplogroup for each individual.

7) hapY
Determine chromosome-Y haplogroup for each male: CpM11, CpM12 and CpM13.



SCRIPT ORDER:

1) processRaw/raw_data/alignAncientMaya.sh for aligning raw reads from novaseq
2) mergePlatform/mergePlatforms.sh         for merging novaseq with miseq (miseq is from pg1)
3) READ/geneticRelatedness.sh              for estimating genetic relatedness of samples
4) mergePlatform/mergeSamples.sh           for merging samples into individuals
5) READ/geneticRelatedness2.sh             for estimating genetic relatedness of individuals
6) sexing/dertermineSex.sh                 for determining molecular sex of individuals
7) hapMt/haplogroupMt.sh                   for determining mitochondrial haplogroups of individuals
8) hapY/haplogroupY.sh                     for determining chromosome-Y haplogroups of males
